title:  Site layout change
---

i'm changing the site layout. my idea for this was essentially "what if the entire layout could look like a console printout?".

i was also thinking of making every page available as a txt file, since, there's nothing here that breaks the text grid other than images, and those you can just display as links.

...but i'm too lazy, so i probably wont â˜º
